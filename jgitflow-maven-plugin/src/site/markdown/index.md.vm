#[[##]]# Features

While this plugin is primarily used to perform releases, it also provides full git-flow functionality including:

* **starting a release** - creates a release branch and updates pom(s) with release versions
* **finishing a release** - runs a maven build (deploy or install), merges the release branch, updates pom(s) with development versions
* **starting a hotfix** - creates a hotfix branch and updates pom(s) with hotfix versions
* **finishing a hotfix** - runs a maven build (deploy or install), merges the hotfix branch, updates pom(s) with previous versions
* **starting a feature** - creates a feature branch
* **finishing a feature** - merges the feature branch

#[[##]]# Differences with the Maven Release Plugin

Although this plugin is based on the maven-release-plugin, it does things a bit differently to provide a cleaner workflow.

The differences are:

* doesn't create any .backup or release.properties files (or any other files in your working tree)
* makes all changes on branches. This means to "roll-back" you can simply delete the branch
* automatically copies any profiles (-P) and user-properties (-D) passed on the command line to the forked maven process when building
* doesn't run site-deploy
* provides the ability to completely turn off maven deployment
* provides the ability to completely turn off remote pushes/tagging
* Only builds your project once in the finish goal. e.g. if you do release-start and release-finish together, your tests only run once
* Never clones your project to a temp folder
* auto tracks origin based on maven scm values if origin tracking is not already setup (I'm looking at you Bamboo!)
* master branch is always kept at the latest release version (not a SNAPSHOT)
